         <h2>About the Car</h2>
         <p>The Ford Kuga is a compact sport utility vehicle (SUV) produced by Ford since 2008. It is based on the C1 platform, which also forms the underpinnings of the Ford Focus and Ford C-Max. Both front-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive are offered. <p>
<p>The Kuga was originally European-designed and sold in Europe and a few other markets, but beginning in 2012 for the 2013 model year, it would be marketed in North America as the Ford Escape. </p>
