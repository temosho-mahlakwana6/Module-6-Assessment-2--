         <h2>About the Car</h2>
         <p>The Toyota Highlander, also known as the Toyota Kluger (Japanese: トヨタ・クルーガー, Toyota Kurūgā), is a mid-size crossover SUV produced by Toyota. It is built on the same platform as used on the Camry.[1][clarification needed]</p>
         <p>Announced in April 2000 at the New York International Auto Show and arriving in late 2000 in Japan and January 2001 in North America, the Highlander became one of the first car-based mid-size SUV or mid-size crossovers.[2] The Highlander is the crossover counterpart to the more rugged, truck-based mid-size 4Runner and became Toyota's best-selling SUV before being surpassed by the smaller RAV4 in 2006. In Japan, the Kluger is exclusive to dealership network called Toyota NETZ as a larger alternative to the RAV4</p>
